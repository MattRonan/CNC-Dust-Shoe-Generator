# CNC-Dust-Shoe-Generator
Uses Processing to visualize and export G-Code for a CNC machine dust shoe.

The goal of this project was to make a dust shoe for a Genmitsu 3018 without involving Fusion 360 or Solid Works.  
Running the Processing sketch lets you see what the current parameters look like, and by pressing ENTER it exports a .nc file to the sketch folder.

There are some notes about things to tweak in the sketch file but the current settings are what were used to build this version:

1) This picture is after cutting out, drilling a 1/8 hole thru front tabs, and installing 4-40 threaded rod + nuts.  This is the time to sand and seal it:

2) Laying out some groups of bristles so that after mixing up some 5-minute epoxy, they can be grabbed and glued into bristle holes quick:

3) Most of the bristles added:

4) Final shoe installed on machine.  I added some small L-brackets on the sides (barely visible brass things on left and right) to attach the shoe more permanently but never had issues with the shoe staying put without them:
